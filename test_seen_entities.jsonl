{"context": "Bath was ravaged in the power struggle between the sons of William the Conqueror following his death in 1087. The victor, William II Rufus, granted the city to a royal physician, John of Tours, who became Bishop of Wells and Abbot of Bath. Shortly after his consecration John bought Bath Abbey's grounds from the king, as well as the city of Bath itself. Whether John paid Rufus for the city or whether he was given it as a gift by the king is unclear. The abbey had recently lost its abbot, \u00c6lfsige, and according to Domesday Book was the owner of large estates in and near the city; it was likely the abbey's wealth that attracted John to take over the monastery. By acquiring Bath, John also acquired the mint that was in the city. In 1090 he transferred the seat, or administration, of the bishopric to Bath Abbey, probably in an attempt to increase the revenues of his see. Bath was a rich abbey, and Wells had always been a poor diocese. By taking over the abbey, John increased his episcopal revenues. William of Malmesbury portrays the moving of the episcopal seat as motivated by a desire for the lands of the abbey, but it was part of a pattern at the time of moving cathedral seats from small villages to larger towns. When John moved his episcopal seat, he also took over the abbey of Bath as his cathedral chapter, turning his diocese into a bishopric served by monks instead of the canons at Wells who had previously served the diocese. John rebuilt the monastic church at Bath, which had been damaged during one of Robert de Mowbray's rebellions.

In either configuration, they comprise a drum (cutterhead) or a flywheel with a number of knives fixed to it that chops and blows the silage out a chute of the harvester into a wagon that is either connected to the harvester or to another vehicle driving alongside. Most larger machines also have paddle accelerators to increase material speed and improve unloading characteristics. Once a wagon is filled up, the wagon can be detached and taken back to a silo for unloading, and another wagon can be attached. Because corn and grass require different types of cutting equipment, there are different heads for each type of silage, and these heads can be connected and disconnected from the harvester. Grass silage is usually cut prior to harvesting to allow it to wilt, before being harvested from swathes with a collection header (windrow pickup). Maize and whole crop silage are cut directly by the header, using reciprocating knives, disc mowers or large saw-like blades. Kernel processors (KP), modules consisting of two mill rolls with teeth pressed together by powerful springs, are frequently used when harvesting cereal crops like corn and sorghum to crack the kernels of these plant heads.

The length of the build-up phase is dependent upon how often injections are administered, but normally ranges from three to six months. After the effective dose is reached, the maintenance phase is implemented, which varies depending upon an individual\u2019s response to the build-up phase.

In 1912, the school's authorities renamed the school Oklahoma College for Women.

This name change was made official by the State Legislature in 1916. The school initially offered four years of high school work and four years of college; those who completed the college course were awarded bachelor's degrees. It gradually shifted its focus to college only; by the 1925-1926 school year, only college classes were offered. Though the school's original name implied strictly industrial training, over the next couple decades, the school gained a focus on a broad liberal arts education. By 1930, it was awarding degrees in many different fields of study, including art, English, history, music, several languages, natural and physical sciences, philosophy, home economics, and physical education.

{"context": "It is an open question who, if anyone, this verse is directed against. At the time the gospel was written the Christian communities had several opponents, who may be being targeted by the author of Matthew in this verse.

There are several false prophets mentioned in the literature of the period such as Simon Magus and Bar Kokba, but the text has no hint that it referring to one of these in particular. France notes that the wording refers to the prophets coming to you implies that these prophets are from outside the community of disciples. The Pharisees are the primary opponent of the righteous through the Gospel of Matthew, and this could be another attack on them. However, seems to make clear that the false prophets are Christian, rather than Jewish. This also could rule out other Jewish sects active in this period such as the Essenes and Zealots. While in later years Christian groups such as the Gnostics would become prominent rivals to mainstream Christianity, Gnosticism was not yet a major concern at the time this Gospel was written. Scholars who see a rivalry between the Jewish Christianity of Mathew and the wider gospel of St. Paul have read this verse as an attack on Pauline Christianity. Schweizer supports the notion that the idea of false prophets is closely attached to eschatology, and that this passage refers to events expected to occur in the end times, not to any current rivals. False prophets were a frequent concern in the Old Testament, such as in Jeremiah. France believes that even without any current threats the history in the Old Testament would lead Jesus to be concerned about the dangers of false prophets.

The main argument of his book is that in the first half of the 19th century, many judges self-consciously allied themselves with a rapidly growing class of mercantile capitalists and promoted a series of legal rules which favored those capitalists.", "mention2entity": {"historiography": ["Q50675"], "Bancroft Prize": ["Q724144"], "Clifford Geertz": ["Q310956"], "Carl Gustav Hempel": ["Q61885"], "Legal History": ["Q680004"], "class": ["Q187588"], "judge": ["Q16533"], "judges": ["Q16533"], "capitalists": ["Q6206"]}, "entity2type": {"Q16533": ["Q15987302"], "Q61885": ["Q1622272", "Q170790"], "Q6206": ["Q1641112"], "Q724144": ["Q11448906"], "Q50675": ["Q11862829", "Q1066186", "Q210588"], "Q680004": ["Q11862829", "Q1066186", "Q1665984"], "Q310956": ["Q1622272", "Q4773904"], "Q187588": ["Q874405"]}}

{"context": "The writers sometimes make jokes at the newsgroup's expense. Within the series, the character Comic Book Guy is often used to represent a stereotypical inhabitant of alt.tv.simpsons. The first such instance occurred in the seventh season episode \"Radioactive Man\", in which Comic Book Guy is logging on to his favorite newsgroup alt.nerd.obsessive. Comic Book Guy's oft-repeated catchphrase, \"Worst episode ever\", first appeared on alt.tv.simpsons in an episode review and writer David S. Cohen decided to use this fan response to lampoon the passion and the fickleness of the fans. In the chapter \"Who Wants Candy\" in the book \"Leaving Springfield\", Robert Sloane finds alt.tv.simpsons an example of an \"active audience ... who struggle to make their own meaning out of the show\". He mentions that in this context, the fans nitpick the show to an extreme and allow no room for error, where the writers believe that nitpicking leads to an under appreciation of the show's qualities. Turner writes in the book \"Planet Simpson\" that \"The Simpsons\" appeared tailor-made for a newsgroup in the early 1990s because it includes minor details that reward attentive viewing and can be easily scrutinized. The episode \"<a href=\"The%20Itchy%20%26amp%3B%20Scratchy%20%26amp%3B%20Poochie%20Show\">The Itchy & Scratchy & Poochie Show</a>\" deals with the viewer backlash and obsession with internal consistency.

Once restrained the animal can be stunned in one of three methods: penetrating captive bolt, non-penetrating captive bolt and gunshot. Most abattoirs use captive bolts over guns. Stunning ensures the animal feels no pain during slaughtering and reduces the animals stress, therefore increasing the quality of meat. The final step is slaughtering, typically the animal will be hung by its back leg and its throat will be slit to allow exsanguination. The hide will be removed for further processing at this point and the animal will be broken down with evisceration and decapitation.

The judicial and executive officers to which privilege of jurisdiction applies, include all judges and counsellors in the courts and tribunals, all members of the public prosecutor's offices attached to the courts and tribunals, the members of the Court of Audit, the Constitutional Court, the Council of State and the Council for Alien Law Litigation, and the governors of the provinces of Belgium. In these exceptional criminal cases, the (suspected) offenders are tried directly by the court of appeal instead of the correctional division of the tribunal of first instance. The court of appeal will then judge the suspects in first and last instance; no further appeal is possible in these cases (except for an appeal in cassation). Whenever a counsellor in a court of appeal or member of its prosecutor-general's office is suspected of such a crime however, the Court of Cassation will transfer the case to a court or tribunal outside of the jurisdiction of the court of appeal involved. For non-correctionalised \"crimes\", the court of appeal or Court of Cassation can only deliver an indictment for a trial by a court of assizes; it does not judge these cases itself. It should also be noted that a criminal action brought against a judge, counsellor or member of a prosecutor's office is distinct from any disciplinary procedure regarding their judicial office, and that a criminal sentence does not necessarily lead to a removal from office.", "mention2entity": {"original jurisdiction": ["Q864400"], "judicial": ["Q6302990"], "executive officers": ["Q1383594"], "public prosecutor's offices": ["Q1092499"], "prosecutor": ["Q1092499"], "prosecutor's office": ["Q1092499"], "Council of State": ["Q1761425"], "governors": ["Q132050"], "provinces of Belgium": ["Q83116"], "Court of Cassation": ["Q1230309"]}, "entity2type": {"Q6302990": ["Q28640"], "Q864400": ["Q471855"], "Q1230309": ["Q190752"], "Q83116": ["Q13220204"], "Q132050": ["Q28640", "Q294414"], "Q1383594": ["Q16631188"], "Q1092499": ["Q732717"], "Q1761425": ["Q1641572"]}}

In a response to efforts by the United Mine Workers of America to unionize the miners in the region, the owners hired detectives of the Baldwin-Felts Agency to evict the families of striking workers from their company-owned housing. In Matewan, this effort was resisted by the chief of police, Sid Hatfield, who objected to the presence of armed detectives in the town. In a standoff on May 19, 1920, shots were fired, and the ensuing shootout resulted in the deaths of 10 men: seven detectives, two miners, and Matewan's mayor. The event served to greatly heighten tensions, and prompted many miners to join the union.

The decision to develop a busway over light rail was based on overall costs of $126 million for a busway versus $300 million for light-rail. However, by 1999 delays in the construction of the busway resulted in a renewed grassroots effort of rail advocates to have light rail placed along Independence. As a result of this campaign, Representative Robin Hayes, who served as a member of the House Transportation Committee, to design the busway in such a manner as to be adapted for light rail when it can be economically justified.

{"context": "By the spring of 1794, the French Republic, under the rule of the National Convention, was at war with all its neighbours. With famine imminent, the French Committee of Public Safety looked to France's colonies and the United States to provide an infusion of grain; this was to be convoyed across the Atlantic during April, May and June, accompanied by a small escort squadron and supported by a second, larger squadron in the Bay of Biscay. However, political upheaval had severely reduced the French Navy's ability to fight coherently and supply shortages had devastated its morale, significantly weakening the fleet. Britain, by contrast, was at a high state of readiness with a well-organised command structure, but was suffering from a severe shortage of trained seamen with which to man its large navy. The French Atlantic Fleet, under Admiral Villaret de Joyeuse, was tasked with keeping the British Channel Fleet occupied long enough for the convoy to reach France safely.

Within two-years, Suburg was looking to expand the curriculum, and approached authorities to allow she and her daughter to teach five years of German and two years of Russian for older girls. Their request was rejected, causing Suburg to give the management of the school over to her daughter. Wiegandt approached authorities again and was approved to continue teaching the five-grade program for another six years.

It was truly the \"Gateway to the Adirondacks.\" By 1930, the State of New York had completed construction of a dam in the Sacandaga River at Conklingville, \"to regulate the waters of the river\", creating the Great Sacandaga Lake. The regulation was said to be needed to aid the water volume of the Hudson River to help ocean-going freighters use the Port of Albany. This flooded a large area, displacing many residents and covering many of the tracks of the FJ&G RR. A priceless photo of the era shows engine number 8 pulling a work crew, riding on top of the rising water as it covered the rails, on the last train out of Cranberry Creek. After the cutoff of the rail lines to Northville, (there were paved roads and lots of automobiles by that point), the bulk of the FJ&G's passenger service was solely by trolley on the interurban lines connecting with Fonda, Amsterdam and Schenectady.", "mention2entity": {"Wells": ["Q3709821"], "Lake Pleasant": ["Q525640"], "dam": ["Q5161224"], "Great Sacandaga Lake": ["Q5599903"], "Fonda": ["Q593663"], "Amsterdam": ["Q478456"]}, "entity2type": {"Q5599903": ["Q131681"], "Q3709821": ["Q15127012", "Q106071004"], "Q593663": ["Q486972"], "Q5161224": ["Q12323"], "Q525640": ["Q15127012", "Q106071004"], "Q478456": ["Q1093829"]}}

He served as a leather-armored soldier (\"soldado de cuera\") at Presidio San Francisco, and married Mar\u00eda de Gracia Padilla in 1811 at Mission Dolores. In 1834, he was granted Rancho Milpitas, an area equal to one square league, or , by the alcalde of San Jos\u00e9, Pedro Chaboya.

In 1852, Anglo squatters were living on the Alviso and Berreyesa grants in numbers too great for the Californios to eject. A man named James Jake described to Nicol\u00e1s Antonio Berreyesa a scheme wherein Berreyesa and three of his sons would emulate the squatters and mark out four new plots to build dwellings and establish their claim on the land. Jake quickly moved into the empty Berreyesa adobe and claimed the whole grant. Berreyesa lost $500 in paying for a failed court battle to regain his rancho. Another Anglo settler laid out Alviso's claim using measurements that included a sizable piece of the Berreyesa claim, including crops and buildings. Berreyesa sued, but his lawyers dropped out of sight while supposedly covering his case in Washington, D.C., losing irreplaceable documents.

{"context": "A significant statement on The Politics of Translation comes from Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak (1998:95-118) who considers translation as an important approach in pursuing the larger feminist agenda of achieving women's `solidarity'. The task of the feminist translator is to consider language as a sign to the working of gendered agency. Translation can give access to a large number of feminists working in various languages and cultures. She adds that a translator must `surrender' to the text, as translation is the most intimate act of reading. It is an act of submitting to the rhetorical dimension of the text. This for Spivak is more of an erotic act than ethical. She also says that one's first responsibility in understanding solidarity is to learn other women's mother tongue rather than consider solidarity as an `a priori' given. Spivak also shows a kind of anxiety for the \u2018Third World' illiterate women and the first task of the feminists is to learn their language rather than impose someone's notion of solidarity and feminism on them. ` There are countless languages in which women all over the world have grown up learning and have been female or feminist, and still the languages we keep learning the most are the powerful European ones, sometimes the powerful Asian ones, least often the chief African ones. Translation for Spivak is an act of understanding the other as well as the self. For her it has a political dimension, as it is a strategy that can be consciously employed.

It did not contain any illustrations originally. In order to make this history more comprehensive and interesting for all ages, Ershuu decided to transform the content of this significant work into Mongolian miniature painting. The idea emerged from his belief that the viewing of images is often easier than reading. One of his main concerns during the development of the comic was to portray ethnic features of the Mongols as well as historical facts and artifacts as precisely and genuine as possible. Therefore, he had to pursue extensive researches which led him into various academic areas.

{"context": "Robinson wrote that \"The Assault on Truth\" was an expression of an \"anti-Freudian mood\" that was growing more aggressive in the 1980s. He suggested that Masson interpreted Freud's work exclusively in terms of a preoccupation with the seduction theory. He accused Masson of claiming, without clear evidence, that the seduction theory was correct, largely ignoring the reasons Freud gave for abandoning the theory, and failing to show that Freud did not consider those reasons persuasive. He accused Masson of misleadingly editing Freud's letters with Fliess. He also maintained that opposition to the seduction theory was based on rational skepticism rather than an inability to accept the existence of childhood sexual abuse, and that it was extremely unlikely that Freud would abandon the seduction theory out of cowardice only to then adopt the provocative theory of infantile sexuality. He was unconvinced by Masson's attempts to use evidence such as Freud's treatment of Eckstein and a paper by Ferenczi to support his views. He argued that Masson viewed children as \"innocent and inert\", and suggested that Masson's work was part of a reaction against the sexual revolution. He compared \"The Assault on Truth\" to two works by psychologists, Frank Sulloway's \"Freud, Biologist of the Mind\" (1979) and Marianne Kr\u00fcll's \"Freud and His Father\" (1979). Eissler wrote that while \"The Assault on Truth\" achieved success, the book was a \"literary hoax\". He accused Masson of misrepresenting the seduction theory by failing to explain that it claimed that \"adult psychopathology emerges exclusively when a child's genitalia had been abused\", and of falsely claiming that Freud disputed the existence of \"infantile abuse\" after abandoning the theory. Elliott noted that the book became a best-seller.

Arrested in June 1950 in Cara\u015fova, where he planned to take a vacation, he was briefly interrogated at Re\u015fi\u0163a before being incarcerated in Bucharest and at Sighet prison. At a show trial involving other clergymen in Bucharest in September 1950, he was accused of being an American and Vatican spy and of Nazi sympathies, his visit to Hitler being brought up. He was sentenced to eighteen years' imprisonment and ten years' deprivation of civic rights, and was fined 880,000 lei and charged 306,000 lei damages against the state. Hoping to avoid the creation of a martyr and to draw public sympathy, the authorities released him in June 1954. Pacha, seriously ill with cancer, returned to Timi\u0219oara the following month and was placed under house arrest in a parish house.

Despite conflicts in the 1660s, the Maan family \"played the leading role in the management of the internal affairs of this eyalet until the closing years of the 17th century, perhaps because it was not possible to manage the province-certainly not in the sanjak of Sidon-Beirut-without them.\"", "mention2entity": {"Ottoman\u2013Habsburg War (1683\u20131699)": ["Q74623"], "Shihab family": ["Q338958"]}, "entity2type": {"Q74623": ["Q198"], "Q338958": ["Q952037"]}}
{"context": "Two ideas about the homology of arms, hands and digits have existed in the past 130 years. First that digits are unique to tetrapods and second that antecedents were present in the fins of early sarcopterygian fish. Until recently it was believed that \"genetic and fossil data support the hypothesis that digits are evolutionary novelties\". However new research that created a three-dimensional reconstruction of Panderichthys, a coastal fish from the Devonian period 385 million years ago, shows that these animals already had many of the homologous bones present in the forelimbs of limbed vertebrates. For example, they had radial bones similar to rudimentary fingers but positioned in the arm-like base of their fins. Thus there was in the evolution of tetrapods a shift such that the outermost part of the fins were lost and eventually replaced by early digits. This change is consistent with additional evidence from the study of actinopterygians, sharks and lungfish that the digits of tetrapods arose from pre-existing distal radials present in more primitive fish. Controversy still exists since Tiktaalik, a vertebrate often considered the missing link between fishes and land-living animals, had stubby leg-like limbs that lacked the finger-like radial bones found in the Panderichthys. The researchers of the paper commented that it \"is difficult to say whether this character distribution implies that Tiktaalik is autapomorphic, that Panderichthys and tetrapods are convergent, or that Panderichthys is closer to tetrapods than Tiktaalik. At any rate, it demonstrates that the fish\u2013tetrapod transition was accompanied by significant character incongruence in functionally important structures.\".", "mention2entity": {"homology": ["Q224180"], "sarcopterygian": ["Q160830"], "Panderichthys": ["Q132313"], "Devonian": ["Q65955"], "Devonian period": ["Q65955"], "radial": ["Q178492"], "tetrapod": ["Q19159"], "tetrapods": ["Q19159"], "shark": ["Q7372"], "sharks": ["Q7372"], "Tiktaalik": ["Q131481"]}, "entity2type": {"Q160830": ["Q713623"], "Q224180": ["Q937228"], "Q65955": ["Q392928"], "Q131481": ["Q23038290"], "Q132313": ["Q23038290"], "Q7372": ["Q951964"], "Q19159": ["Q25241"], "Q178492": ["Q265868"]}}

{"context": "Mussels are the organism of choice for monitoring contaminant levels in the coastal regions for a number of reasons. Most mussels are generally sessile and cannot move to another location if their environment has become contaminated; this makes them good measures of environmental pollution. Mussels do not readily metabolize some of the organics that vertebrates do, making them a better choice when tracking substances such as PAHs. In addition, most mussels are filter feeders and filter water through their bodies to feed. This filtration makes them prime targets for picking up contaminants in the water. Mussels can provide information on if a system is recovering and if a remediation or cleanup effort is effective. In a successful remediation effort a decline of contaminants in the organisms is expected. An example of this is in Lavaca Bay, Texas, which is a site that has been contaminated due to chronic mercury releases from a nearby facility. By monitoring the mercury levels in oysters over several years it was discovered that the mercury content in the bay was decreasing. Due to the nature of their filter feeding, bivalves allow Mussel Watch to tracks changes in contamination levels in the environment by monitoring bivalve tissue concentrations. This is important because it can show whether a policy that is meant to protect and clean the environment or an ecosystem is actually working. Mussel Watch can be used to evaluate current policies to determine what, if any, changes need to be made to ensure that there is an improvement in environmental health.", "mention2entity": {"filter feeders": ["Q1252491"]}, "entity2type": {"Q1252491": ["Q159344"]}}

While these three schools seem to have valued mental equanimity, it appears that the fourth school of Sceptics, associated with the philosopher Sanjaya Belatthiputta, did not share this value.

The slow movement draws on the same model and the Scherzo follows the standard binary form.\" The first movement opens with a fifty bar slow introduction, laying out thematic material used later. As Werbeck notes, within this introduction, Strauss goes through a series of modulations in which one two-bar theme is repeated in a sequence from D min, Bflat7, Eflat, B7, Emin, C, Fmin, Dflat, ending in F. This wondering tonality is in contrast to the otherwise conservative musical conception of the symphony, and perhaps prefigures the future Strauss. The exposition starts with a shift to 3/4, and the transition uses thematic material both from the first theme and the introduction. \"This opening movement also contains the first genuine development section in any symphonic work by Strauss. His technique for development in this lengthy subsection (188 bars) consists primarily repeating the material...as it sequences through various harmonic levels. This section marks the first time that Strauss went beyond the safety of a codified formal plan\". By the age of sixteen, Strauss was writing a symphony which \"need not be excused as a \"student\" work\".

{"context": "Teenagers occupy a large part in China, so the Youth unemployment rate also has a necessary impact on the economic development of China. In the past, a low-skilled young population found it easy to find a job, but with economic stagnation, they might face increasing difficulties in seeking or maintaining jobs. Additionally, as these jobs tend to be low-paid and with little social security like unemployment welfare and insurance, these young workers face various forms of social hardship and this has an effect on the progress and growth of society. At the same time, a large variety of graduates cannot compete for jobs with top university graduates, they are not willing to take low-quality, low-paid jobs. These so-called \u201cneet group\u201d would rather stay at home and rely on their parents to survive than go out to work. Most parents encourage this behavior, because lots of parents have to keep low-skilled jobs to seed their children to college, so they cannot accept their children will end up doing the same job as them. In this respect, these group of population waste their job opportunity cost and result in youth unemployment issue in China. Furthermore, in recent labor market, the unemployment issue among the young generation is structural unemployment, this results from a mismatch between the nature of job conditions and the skills. At the same time, college graduates cannot find a job because of the teaching and learning environment in 1999. According to the research, there are 750,000 college graduates could not find a job upon graduation, the number sharply increased to 1.2 million in 2005, and nearly 2 million in 2009. The real numbers might be higher than official data. However, no every college graduate cannot find a job, it depends on the reputation of the university. For example, the top ten university students in China are easily finding a high salary job comparing to other universities with a less known and inferior brand. Therefore, this reflects the disparity in education. The faculty level and environmental conditions of top universities are stronger than those of unknown universities. Moreover, for larger number of high school students it is so difficult for them to enter the top ten universities in China, so they can hardly compete with these students to find jobs after graduation.", "mention2entity": {"Youth unemployment": ["Q4261734"]}, "entity2type": {"Q4261734": ["Q41171"]}}

In allergic asthma, lung inflammation is caused by a CD4 T cell that attacks otherwise harmless allergens. This attack can trigger an immune reaction which damages bodily tissue. Boyton has studied how the body responds to pollen, in an effort to improve treatment for people who suffer from hayfever. She showed that it was peptide 26 in the pollen that is most regularly recognised by the immune system. In 2016 she was awarded a Medical Research Council (MRC) grant to investigate correlates of immunity to Zika virus.", "mention2entity": {"St Mary's Hospital": ["Q3495342"], "Royal Free Hospital": ["Q7374196"], "Royal Free": ["Q7374196"], "Medical Research Council": ["Q746879"], "MRC": ["Q746879"], "allergic asthma": ["Q35869"], "asthma": ["Q35869"], "CD4 T cell": ["Q632518"], "hayfever": ["Q272436"]}, "entity2type": {"Q7374196": ["Q1813474"], "Q35869": ["Q279330"], "Q746879": ["Q3343298"], "Q3495342": ["Q1059324"], "Q272436": ["Q114085"], "Q632518": ["Q189118"]}}
